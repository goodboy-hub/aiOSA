    """(Multifractal) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA or MFDFA).

    Python implementation of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) or
    Multifractal DFA of a signal. Detrended fluctuation analysis, much like the
    Hurst exponent, is used to find long-term statistical dependencies in time
    series.

    This function can be called either via `fractal_dfa()` or
    `complexity_dfa()`, and its multifractal variant can be directly accessed
    via `fractal_mfdfa()` or `complexity_mfdfa()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.

    windows : list
        A list containing the lengths of the windows (number of data points in
        each subseries). Also referred to as 'lag' or 'scale'. If 'default',
        will set it to a logarithmic scale (so that each window scale has the
        same weight) with a minimum of 4 and maximum of a tenth of the length
        (to have more than 10 windows to calculate the average fluctuation).

    overlap : bool
        Defaults to True, where the windows will have a 50% overlap
        with each other, otherwise non-overlapping windows will be used.

    integrate : bool
        It is common practice to convert the signal to a random walk (i.e.,
        detrend and integrate, which corresponds to the signal 'profile'). Note
        that it leads to the flattening of the signal, which can lead to the
        loss of some details (see Ihlen, 2012 for an explanation). Note that for
        strongly anticorrelated signals, this transformation should be applied
        two times (i.e., provide `np.cumsum(signal - np.mean(signal))` instead
        of `signal`).

    order : int

       The order of the polynomial trend for detrending, 1 for the linear trend.

    multifractal : bool
        If true, compute Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA), in
        which case the argument `q` is taken into account.

    q : list or np.array (default `2`)
        The sequence of fractal exponents when `multifractal=True`. Must be a
        sequence between `-10` and `10` (note that zero will be removed, since
        the code does not converge there). Setting `q = 2` (default) gives a
        result of a standard DFA. For instance, Ihlen (2012) uses
        `q = [-5, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5]`. In general, positive q moments amplify
        the contribution of fractal components with larger amplitude and
        negative q moments amplify the contribution of fractal with smaller
        amplitude (Kantelhardt et al., 2002)

    show : bool
        Visualise the trend between the window size and the fluctuations.

    Returns
    ----------
    dfa : dict
        If `multifractal` is False, the dictionary contains q value, a series of windows, fluctuations of each window and the
        slopes value of the log2(windows) versus log2(fluctuations) plot. If `multifractal` is True, the dictionary
        additionally contains the parameters of the singularity spectrum (scaling exponents, singularity dimension, singularity
        strength; see `singularity_spectrum()` for more information).


    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=10, noise=0.05)
    >>> dfa1 = nk.fractal_dfa(signal, show=True)
    >>> dfa1 #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> dfa2 = nk.fractal_mfdfa(signal, q=np.arange(-5, 6), show=True)
    >>> dfa2 #doctest: +SKIP

def singularity_spectrum(windows, fluctuations, q, slopes):
    """Extract the slopes of the fluctuation function to futher obtain the
    singularity strength `α` (or Hölder exponents) and singularity spectrum
    `f(α)` (or fractal dimension). This is iconically shaped as an inverse
    parabola, but most often it is difficult to obtain the negative `q` terms,
    and one can focus on the left side of the parabola (`q>0`).

    Note that these measures rarely match the theoretical expectation,
    thus a variation of ± 0.25 is absolutely reasonable.

    The parameters are mostly identical to `fractal_mfdfa()`, as one needs to
    perform MFDFA to obtain the singularity spectrum. Calculating only the
    DFA is insufficient, as it only has `q=2`, and a set of `q` values are
    needed. Here defaulted to `q = list(range(-5,5))`, where the `0` element
    is removed by `_cleanse_q()`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    windows : list
        A list containing the lengths of the windows. Output of `_fractal_dfa()`.

    fluctuations : np.ndarray
        The detrended fluctuations, from DFA or MFDFA. Output of `_fractal_dfa()`.

    q : list or np.array (default `np.linspace(-10,10,41)`)
        The sequence of fractal exponents. Must be a sequence between -10
        and 10 (note that zero will be removed, since the code does not converge
        there). If "default", will takes the form `np.linspace(-10,10,41)`.

    slopes : np.ndarray
        The slopes of each `q` power obtained with MFDFA. Output of `_slopes()`.

    Returns
    -------
    tau: np.array
        Scaling exponents `τ`. A usually increasing function of `q` from
        which the fractality of the data can be determined by its shape. A truly
        linear tau indicates monofractality, whereas a curved one (usually
        curving around small `q` values) indicates multifractality.

    hq: np.array
        Singularity strength `hq`. The width of this function indicates the
        strength of the multifractality. A width of `max(hq) - min(hq) ≈ 0`
        means the data is monofractal.

    Dq: np.array
        Singularity spectrum `Dq`. The location of the maximum of `Dq` (with
         `hq` as the abscissa) should be 1 and indicates the most prominent
         exponent in the data.

def _hurst_exponents_plot(q, hq, ax=None):
    """
    Plots the generalised Hurst exponents with `q` in the abscissa and
    `hq` in the ordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q: np.array
        q powers.

    hq: np.array
        Generalised Hurst coefficients `hq` as calculated with
        `hurst_exponents()`.

    Notes
    -----
    This was first designed and implemented by Leonardo Rydin in
    `MFDFA <https://github.com/LRydin/MFDFA/>`_ and ported here by the same.
